## Example scripts

The example scripts should test the general working condition of the robot with motors and brain. We have example programs in python and blockcode to check motors or GPS sensor.

## Pneumatic

If connected to port A the pneumatic piston will expand and collapse every second, counting up with each cycle and printing it on the screen to determine the maximum cycle count (around 40) with a fully charged 100 psi cylinder.

More documentation done by students.
